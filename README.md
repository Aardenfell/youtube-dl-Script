##### [ Made for Windows 10 ]
# youtube-dl-Script
A small script that downloads just about any video on the internet with just the URL. Has FFmpeg support

### How to use
Just run the batch file.
If you don't have youtube-dl.exe installed already the script will prompt you to download it. Otherwise you can grab it from [here](http://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/download.html)

### FFmpeg Support
If you want FFmpeg to work you must have already downloaded the Windows version from [here](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/). Scroll down until you find something like this and make sure you download the `ffmpeg-git-full` package.

Extract the contents into the same location as the script and batch file. Rename the extracted folder to `FFmpeg`
